      "q": "What does “Boid” mean?",
      "a": "Boid is short for bird-oid. A computer simulation of birds in a flock. Each “boid” follows simple rules of interaction with nearby boids. Many boids interacting results in emergent meta patterns. Likewise, the Boid Platform relies on computing resources from a large number of individual contributors. These small contributions cumulate into massive real-world impact."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is Boid?",
      "a": "At the heart of Boid is the desire to make the benefits of blockchain technology accessible to all people. Boid acts as a gateway, lowering the barrier to entry for non-technical users to directly participate in blockchains and distributed computing projects. Boid has a social network layer, where users can join together in teams and compete on global leaderboards."
    },
    {
      "q": "Who is Boid for?",
      "a": "Boid is for anyone who wants to be part of something huge. We designed Boid from the ground up to be as accessible as technologically possible. Anyone with a computer (or compatible smartphone) and internet connection can use Boid."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I participate in Boid?",
      "a": "Participation on Boid is all about increasing your Boid Power rating. To increase your Boid Power, you either need to contribute computing power by running the Boid application on your devices, or invite people using your invite link."
    },
    {
      "q": "What happens when a person joins Boid using my invite link?",
      "a": "That person will automatically join your team and a small percentage of the Boid power generated by their devices will be credited towards you. There is no limit on the number of people you can invite or the Boid Power you can earn from those whom you invited."
    },
    {
      "q": "How can I contribute computing power towards Boid?",
      "a": "To increase your Boid Power , you need to install the simple Boid application on your device. The Boid application runs in the background, transparently taking advantage of unused computing power. The Boid application connects to your Boid account, and can tap into your CPU, GPU, and HDD space automatically, to maximize your Boid Power rating. You can install the Boid app on as many of your devices as you like. Desktop computers with dedicated GPUs tend to perform the best, but laptops and cell-phones can also work as well."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is Boid safe?",
      "a": "Security is a top priority for Boid. We only work with the most reputable distributed science projects, and we architected the Boid app such that applications have limited permissions. It’s worth noting that BOINC (the tech behind Boid) has been commonly used since the late 90s with a perfect security track record due to a robust security architecture. We continue to roll out updates to make Boid even more secure and hacker-proof."

  teams: [{
      "q": "What is a Boid team?",
      "a": "A Boid team is a group of users who are gathered around a specific brand or idea."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I have to be on a team?",
      "a": "All users on Boid participate as part of a team. If you can't find a team that you want to join you can just stay in the default Boid team or start your own team."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is a Boid Team leader?",
      "a": "Team leaders are responsible for managing the incentives and rewards that a team provides to its users. Team leaders are a big reason you might choose one team over another."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the benefits of being a team leader on Boid?",
      "a": "Team leaders can capitalize on their existing audiences outside of Boid to engage with their community in interesting new ways. Team leaders receive a percentage of the Boid Power generated by the team. The can choose to use this Boid Power to generate cryptocurrencies or donate it to important causes."

  apps: [{
      "q": "What is the boid web app?",
      "a": "The Boid Web app is a dashboard and social gateway for the Boid ecosystem. In the web app you can view your your wallet, user profile, leaderboards and team details. Additionally, you can manage devices which you have linked to your Boid account.\n"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the boid desktop app?",
      "a": "The Boid Desktop app acts as a wrapper over multiple blockchains and distributed scientific computing technologies. The Boid apps automatically connect and run various computing tasks based on your computer hardware. The app connects to your Boid account, and can tap into your CPU, GPU, and HDD space automatically. You can install the Boid app on as many of your devices as you like. Desktop computers with dedicated GPUs tend to perform the best, but laptops and cell-phones can also work as well.\n"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is distributed computing?",
      "a": "Distributed science projects help researchers to solve some large and complex problem which would otherwise be prohibitively expensive to run on a specialized supercomputer or take decades or centuries to run on a single desktop computer."
    },
    {
      "q": "What benefits does Distributed Scientific Computing have for society?",
      "a": "Volunteers in distributed scientific computing projects have donated millions of years of computing power to dozens of fascinating projects that study things like cures for cancer, the formation of galaxies, more efficient solar cell materials, enormous prime numbers, and much more. These efforts have contributed to hundreds of scientific publications, articles, and presentations. This incredible contribution has been made possible by hundreds of thousands of people volunteering the spare processing power of their PCs, laptops, office computers (often left on overnight or during lunch), or Android devices to boost research projects (some of which have been running since the late 1990’s). \n"

  tokenization: [{
      "q": "What is the BOID?",
      "a": "Boid will have a native cryptocurrency called BOID. The token will be airdropped to EOS token holders in 2018 Q3. You can earn BOID IOUs during the Alpha by running the Boid app. More details about tokeneconomics will be released soon."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the function of BOIDs?",
      "a": "The Boid token (BOID) unlocks advanced functionality on the Boid platform. Users can stake their BOIDs to upgrade their account functionality. Staking BOIDS is required to create a Boid Team and issue team assets. BOIDs can also be staked for Proof-of-stake mining and voting. Staking BOIDs is required to operate a Boid masternode."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I get BOIDs?",
      "a": "When you participate in Boid you get to choose how you would like to be paid out. In addition to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, you can choose to be paid in the native BOID. Additionally, if you are an EOS token holder you will receive some BOID tokens during the airdrop. You can also earn BOIDs by performing social functions on the platform like inviting your friends."
